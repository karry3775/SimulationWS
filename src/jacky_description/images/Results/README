Meaning of plot names
#####################
# The plot names are of the format 'run<num>_traj.png' and 'run<num>_yaw.png'
  These names correspond to the error plots on the google sheets indicated by column number Run number on the sheets.

# There are some additional plots in the shared folder named 'warehouse' for which error plots are not available in the google sheets, since they were trial runs.

####################
Error plots
####################
# Error plots can be found in the 'results' google sheets.

# It contains two sheets
  - laser_stereo_comp --> contains data
  - plot_compatible --> contains bar plots

# X error means the longitudinal error
# Y error means the latitudinal error
# All lengths are in meters
# All angles are in radians

# There are a total of 3 types of  error terms
  - Terminal error -> error recorded at the final point
  - Average error -> error averaged over the entire trajectory
  - % error -> Average error / traj length

# The results are segregated by simulation environment used

#######################
Simulation Environments
#######################
# The simulation environments used can be found in 'simulation environment used' folder in png format
